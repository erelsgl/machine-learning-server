i propose 9 hours, with car
how about 20000 with nothing else
our stand work day is 10 hours for all employees.
20000 nis, team manager, no leased car, 10% pension, fast promotion, 10 working hours
12000 nis, programmer, with car, 20% pension slow promotion track, 9 hours
i'm sorry, i meant project manager.
i think you should be a programmer.
okay, 7000 , programmer, no leased car, 20% pension,fast promotion track, but - 8 hours a day
leased car?
yes, fast promotion track
time is running out, so: 12000 , programmer, with leased car, 0% pension, fast promotion, 9 hours

with 10% pension you can get a car.
yes we can
i will add a leased car

10 hours per day
10%
i reject that idea
