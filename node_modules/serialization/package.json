The native Node.js serialization\nmechanism is JSON.stringify/JSON.parse, but, these functions handle only data fields - not functions \nor class prototypes.\n\nThis library suggests the following solution (pseudo-code).\n\nOn the home machine:\n\n\tfunction createNewClassifier() {\n\t\t// Write code to create a fresh  (untrained) classifier.\n\t\t// This code should be stand-alone - it should include all the 'require' statements\n\t\t//   required for creating the classifier.\n\t\t// Use \"__dirname\" to refer to the current folder, \n\t\t//   so that the result will be able to run on another folder. \n\t}\n\t\n\tvar myClassifier = createNewClassifier();\n\n\tmyClassifier.train(dataset);\n\t\n\tvar serialize = require('serialize'); // require the current package\n\t\n\tvar myClassifierString = serialize.toString(myClassifier, createNewClassifier);\n\t\n\t// save myClassifierString to a file, and send to the remote server.\n\t// the createNewClassifier function is also saved.\n\nOn the remote server:\n\n\tvar myClassifierString = // read from file\n\t\n\tvar serialize = require('serialize'); // require the current package\n\n\tvar baseFolder = __dirname; // this comes in place of the \"__dirname\"s in createNewClassifier \n\n\tvar myClassifier = serialize.fromString(myClassifierString, baseFolder);\n\t\n\tmyClassifier.classify(sample);\n\nThe demos folder contains two working demos (demo1 and demo2), and one non-working demo (demo3) that is left for future work.",
