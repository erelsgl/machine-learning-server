Reject Offer problem: "input": "I will not offer a leased car",

* truthteller 
check 'no' and 'without'

* problem of attribute/vaue identification with intent annotation, ex. in the following example 'no leased car' can be annotated as 'without leased car' or 'no' can be annotated as Reject of Leased car.
"no leased car but you will get fast prmotion track"
'without leased car' aatribute or 'no' reject

* polarity of attributes, the following example doesn't accept salary, so it's reject
'offer accepted about car, not salary'

* This is a good example for seeking root for every attribute/value
'9 hours, i can not do less, please accept'

* depparser mistake
'9 hours, i can not do less, please accept'
9 is a child of do in dep parser which is an error

reject, here was classified correctly becuase of NO 
* great example of polarity, this example has a strong keyphrase of offer, but 'no' changes the polarity of the sentence to Reject
'your offer is not going to happen'
'I cant offer you a leased car'

* for some reson Query has a positive bias
this is very simialr to Query
'how does 20000 nis long term sound to you?'

* truthteller,the th annotation is correct, but human use the Accept in this way, the meaning of the sentence is Accept but the polarity is unknown 
i think+ we agree-
Accept
but agree with - sign

* comparison scheme can not distinguish different phrasal verbs
throw in
throw out
for comparison it is the same meaning, because in POS tagger is considered as different words

* motivation for truthteller, if truthteller recognize future sense
"input": "I will accept 8 working hours",
Offer but correlate with "accept"

* in the run of evaluation it s shown the relation between Offer-Accept-Reject
Reject is negation of Offer and Accept
Offer is the future of Accept

Query":"reject"
# how agent use it

"Query":"accept"
# how agent use it
# it is ambiguous
# intersection with insist?

"Query":"compromise"
# how to use compomise

"Query":"issues" == "Query":"bid"

"Insist"
# how agent use insist

"Insist":"previous"

# no aggrement == reject

# '9 hours day sounds cool to me'
were classified as Accept but annotated as "offer"
where Accept is more appropriate but human chooses this way to express Offer

# easy first problem
